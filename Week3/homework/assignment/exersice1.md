Step 1: Identify Columns Violating 1NF:

The "food_code" and "food_description" columns contain multiple values separated by commas. This violates 1NF because these columns should contain atomic (indivisible) values.
Step 2: Identify Entities:

It seems that the table contains information about members, dinners, venues, and foods. We can extract these entities:

Members
Dinners
Venues
Foods
Step 3: Create Tables for 3NF Compliance:

Let's create separate tables for each entity to achieve 3NF compliance:

Members Table:

Table Name: Members
Columns:
member_id (Primary Key)
member_name
member_address
Dinners Table:

Table Name: Dinners
Columns:
dinner_id (Primary Key)
dinner_date
Venues Table:

Table Name: Venues
Columns:
venue_code (Primary Key)
venue_description
Foods Table:

Table Name: Foods
Columns:
food_code (Primary Key)
food_description
Attendance Table (to handle the many-to-many relationship between members and dinners):

Table Name: Attendance
Columns:
member_id (Foreign Key referencing Members table)
dinner_id (Foreign Key referencing Dinners table)
FoodAttendance Table (to handle the many-to-many relationship between dinners and foods):

Table Name: FoodAttendance
Columns:
dinner_id (Foreign Key referencing Dinners table)
food_code (Foreign Key referencing Foods table)
